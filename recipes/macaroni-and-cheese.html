                <li>The sauce will start to thicken up thanks to the roux. At this point we will cut the velveeta cheese into small cubes and add them to the sauce. We must keep mixing.</li>
                <li>Once the sauce starts to become bright yellow, lets add our other cheeses. Add the colby jack, cheddar, and mexican cheese blend.</li>
