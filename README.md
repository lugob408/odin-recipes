In this project we will learn how to create a website with recipes that lists various recipes and other things that will
challenge our html learning. At the end of this project, I hope to have the skills to create my own projects and have a better grasp at using html as well. 
At the end of this project, I will have all the knowledge to be able to do these things on my own.
